It's forbidden to merge non consecutive video snippets. [1,2] is valid but [1,3] is not.
It's forbidden to skip indexes. all indexes must be included in one of the merged videosnippets.

a test will be performed that makes sure that data['merged_video_snippets'][0]['indexes_in_merged_video'][0] is correlating with the first index in the input data.
